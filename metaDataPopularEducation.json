"description":"Remind (formerly Remind101) offers teachers a free, safe and simple way to instantly text students & parents. Teachers, coaches, or administrators can send reminders, assignments, homework, assessments, or motivational messages directly to students' & parents' phones. Messaging is safe because phone numbers are kept private. Teachers save time because they can send quick, one-way Announcements, or opt-in to Chat for personalized communication with a student or parent. For students and parents, Remind provides an easier way to stay informed outside of the classroom.\n\nTeachers, students, and parents can download the Remind app to stay connected more easily. If you love Remind, share it with your colleagues or write a review!\n\nBLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK: “Jessica D, a teacher in Louisiana, uses Remind daily to brief parents on whether their children did well in class and what their homework is for the night. She says the app has led more students to complete their homework and even credits it with improving scores on standardized tests. “The word I use is ‘transform,’ ” she says. “It transformed my classroom. And I think it made me a better teacher.”\n\nPARENTING: According to a study conducted by Harvard University, on average, teacher-family communication increased the odds a student completed their homework by 42% and decreased instances in which teachers had to redirect students' attention to the task at hand by 25%. Parent-teacher communication is clearly key to a student's success, and Remind can help.\n\nBUZZFEED: “...SMS allows the app to be used by parents without smartphones. Brett Kopf said that Remind’s features have proved especially popular in low-income districts, where parent engagement is a key issue for teachers, and parents’ sometimes erratic work schedules can make it difficult to get in touch by phone.”", "genreIds":["6017", "6005"], "releaseDate":"2012-05-03T01:36:04Z", "sellerName":"Remind101, Inc.", "bundleId":"com.remind101.Remind101",

"description":"ClassDojo offers a beautiful classroom management platform for teachers to easily encourage any behavior or skill in the classroom and keep parents in the loop.\n\nUnlike most classroom management tools and behavior trackers like gold-star charts, ClassDojo helps teachers focus on positive feedback. Teachers can customize the behaviors or skills, such as “Working hard” and “Participating”, and instantly award students in class Dojo points for doing the right thing.\n\nTeachers can also put different sets of students into groups, offering a simple way for teachers to award table points and foster a collaborative classroom culture.\n\nBest of all, teachers can engage parents and provide them with a way to stay connected to the classroom and know how their child is doing. Parents can see their child’s feedback from school in real-time, and view any comments made by teachers. \n\nTeachers can broadcast a message to all parents (such as sharing a reminder, assignment, homework, or permission slip), and also send private, meaningful communications like text messages and photos so that parents are connected to the classroom without the hassle of emails and school newsletters.\n\nStudents can create their own accounts, customize their Dojo avatars, and self-reflect on their performance while in school or at home.\n\nUnlike most classroom management organizers and class planners, ClassDojo can be used on any device: laptops, iPhones, iPads, tablets and phones, as well as smartboards - and it syncs seamlessly across all of them in real-time! \n\nThe ClassDojo Support Team is top-notch, and available around the clock if you ever need help, too!", "formattedPrice":"Free", "artistId":552602059, "artistName":"Class Twist Inc.", "genres":["Education", "Productivity"], "price":0.00, "currency":"USD", "genreIds":["6017", "6007"], "releaseDate":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z", "sellerName":"Class Twist Inc.", "bundleId":"com.ClassDojo",

"description":"*** Now over 4 million downloads.  Thanks users!***\n\nA powerful, flexible graphing calculator . . . and it's free!\n\nDoes far more than most of the paid calculators out there . . . let alone the free ones.\n\nFeatures:\n\n1)  Scientific Calculator.  Simple to grasp and easy to use, but powerful features are available when you need them.  Available functions include the following:\n\n• the usual arithmetic functions and exponentiation.\n• square root, cube root, nth root, natural log, log base 10, log of arbitrary base, absolute value, factorial, permutations (nPr), combinations (nCr), modulus, random integer, bell curve, cumulative normal distribution, decimal to fraction.\n\n2)  Graphing.  Capabilities:\n\n• Graph up to four equations at once.\n• Graphs are labeled.\n• You can drag the graph or pinch to zoom in or out.\n• Calculator can find roots and intersections.\n• Graph in polar coordinates. \n• Graph parametric equations\n• Can graph implicit functions, such as x^2+y^2-4=0.  Most calculator apps can't do this!\n\n3)  A unit converter.  With a tap, you can enter the result of your conversion into the calculator.  Currently converts different units of the following: acceleration, angle, area, density, distance, energy, force, mass, power, pressure, speed, temperature, time, and volume.  Great for doing physics homework!\n\n4)  Constants for scientific calculations -- speed of light, strength of gravity at Earth's surface, etc. etc. etc.  Tapping on a constant will insert it into your calculation -- i.e, you don't have to key in the value.  Again, great for doing physics homework!\n\n5)  It can make a table of the values of any function you care to enter.  You can choose the starting x value of the table, as well as how much x increases for each successive row.\n\n6) Help screens linked directly to many of the available functions and constants.  Tap the disclosure arrow to see the definition.\n\n7)  Forgot the quadratic formula?  Or the double-angle formulas for sine and cosine?  The math/science reference hits the high points of various subjects.  Currently includes algebra, differential and integral calculus, geometry, trigonometry, vectors, vector calculus, and classical mechanics.  \n\n8) Keep track of significant figures [AKA sig figs]\n\n9) Statistics -- enter data and make a histogram, box and whisker plot, or scatter plot with optional regression line.\n\nIf you are viewing this in iTunes, you will see five iPhone screenshots and five iPad screenshots.  But even ten shots don't come close to showing everything this calculator can do.\n\nI'd love to hear your comments or suggestions.  You can write me at mathscixyzgraphcalc@gmail.com -- but without the xyz.

"description":"VocabularySpellingCity is a fun way to learn spelling and vocabulary words by playing engaging games using any word list. The most popular activities are Spelling TestMe, HangMouse, and our vocabulary and phonics games, available to Premium Members. The most popular word lists are Sound Alikes, Compound Words, Hunger Games and SAT Words. The free app includes ten of our most popular learning activities and ten of our most popular word lists.\n\nSpelling TestMe is a spelling test that reads each word aloud, uses it in a sentence, and repeats the word. Students can work at their own pace and receive instant feedback upon submitting the completed test.\n\nHangMouse is a VocabularySpellingCity favorite that lets children decode each word in a friendly version of traditional Hangman. Kids love trying to figure out the word before the cat catches the mouse.\n\nMissing Letter is a fun game for kids of all ages. Even the youngest learners can practice letter recognition by trying to find the missing letter that completes each spelling or vocabulary word.\n\nAlphabetize is an activity that can be used to practice putting words in alphabetical order, a vital early literacy skill. Students love to play ABC order activities and games.\n\nSpelling TeachMe is a great activity to introduce a new word list to students. Each word is read aloud, spelled letter-by-letter and used in a context-rich sentence.\n\nSentence Unscramble helps students practice sentence structure as well as using words in context by unscrambling words to form a complete sentence.\n\nWord Unscramble is a popular word game that is a variation of other word games such as text twists, jumbles and anagrams.\n\nRead-A-Word is an activity that gives students practice recognizing new words. Can you find the words that you hear?\n\nTest-N-Teach gives students the opportunity to learn as they practice. Students do their best to build a monument to good spelling. The better they spell, the better their monument!\n\nWant to add your own word lists? Custom word lists may be entered by registered members (registration to save lists is free!) on www.spellingcity.com for use in the games and activities on VocabularySpellingCity’s app.\n\nWant more games on the app?

If that’s not enough, upgrade to get all 50 lessons and additional side quests for up to 40 hours of content and give your vocabulary a total body workout, Spanish-style.\n\n* PRESS *\n\nUSA Today\nOne of the top-three iOS apps that “make the process of learning new words fun.”\n\nTeachers With Apps \n“As students explore and practice...they devour Spanish words and phrases that are clearly and distinctly enunciated with audio clips from native speakers!”\n\nApp Safari\n\"This app is not just your average, run-of-the-mill crash course... It includes complex exercises, challenges, and lessons that make the learning process fun and effective.\"\n\n* FEATURES * \n\n-- 9 addictive and unique games\n-- 1000+ Spanish words & phrases to study and master\n-- Spoken audio clips provided by a native Spanish speaker to help with pronunciation\n-- Hand-illustrated image library to help memorize words\n-- 50 Spanish lessons designed by Ivy League instructors (upgrade required)\n-- Personalized learning algorithms to maximize memorization, retention & contextual usage\n-- Enhanced review mode lets you replay previously mastered lessons\n-- Additional quests & challenges will keep you motivated\n-- Not a single tedious, boring, mind-numbing or snooze-inducing quiz, class or lesson allowed\n\n* WHAT OUR (SUPER AWESOME) FANS HAVE TO SAY *\n\n“I highly recommend this to those of you that want a quick, easy, and on-the-go way to learn Spanish!”\n\n“I recently stumbled upon MindSnacks as an app for use with my students who are learning Spanish. What a gem! The game-based structure makes learning fun and exciting while also being motivational.”\n\n“I just downloaded how to speak Spanish and ended up getting all the languages because it’s so easy and it is a great way to learn new languages. It's fun too!”\n\n* THE SCIENCE BEHIND MINDSNACKS *\n\nAt MindSnacks we like to keep it fun, but we’re serious about learning. That’s why our Spanish app includes 9 challenging games designed by Ivy League professors. Each game teaches a specific aspect of the language, creating a well-rounded learning experience for both kids and adults that goes far beyond basic vocabulary flashcards. \n\nOf course studying is only worth it if it works, so our unique algorithm reinforces the learning process using proven methods from the field of memory studies. Over time, the games adapt to your individual performance, selectively repeating Spanish words, phrases and grammatical points with which you’ve previously struggled. In other words, as you learn Spanish, the app learns about you for a more effective learning experience. \n\nPerfect for beginning and intermediate learners of Latin American Spanish, MindSnacks is like your own personal Spanish teacher you can take just about anywhere . You’ll quickly become less reliant on that Spanish dictionary and learn the grammar and vocab needed for traveling in Spain or other Spanish-speaking countries. \n\n* SUPPORT *\n\nFor more information or support, please contact us at support@mindsnacks.com.

Look through the eyes of your iPhone or iPad* to see a high-tech window into the whole visible universe.\n\nAll you have to do is point your AR enabled device* at the sky and Star Chart will tell you exactly what you are looking at.\n\nUsing state of the art GPS technology, an accurate 3D simulation of the visible universe, and a great deal of technical wizardry, Star Chart calculates – in real time - the current location of every star, planet and moon visible from Earth and shows you precisely where they are; even in broad daylight!\n\nWant to know what that bright star is called? Point your device* at it – you might just find out it’s a planet!\n\nWant to know what the night sky looks like to people on the other side of the earth? Well just point your device down!\n\nWant to know where your star sign is in the sky? Star Chart will tell you all this and more.\n\n\nStar Charts features include:\n- Just point and view. When you hold your device up to the sky, Star Chart will automatically start tracking your movements to match the sky *.\n\n- Alternatively, look around the sky using finger gestures – perfect for armchair astronomers!\n\n- In a single app of less than 30MB, Star Chart dynamically scales its visuals and capabilities across all iOS devices to meet the high end capabilities of a retina display iPad while also running smoothly on the earliest iPhones and iPods.\n\n- Accurately depicts all the visible stars of the northern and southern hemispheres - a total of approximately 120,000 stars!\n\n- Fly to and explore all the planets of the solar system, their moons and the sun all rendered in beautiful 3D with state of the art visual effects. \n\n- Using the powerful Time Shift feature, simply tap the time button and smoothly shift up to 10,000 years forward or backward in time.\n\n- Displays all 88 constellations, with constellation imagery based on the beautiful artwork by 17th century astronomer Johannes Hevelius.\n\n- Includes the complete Messier catalogue of 110 exotic deep sky objects.\n\n- Tap on anything in the sky and get the facts on what you are looking at, including distance and brightness.\n\n- Very powerful zoom function, lets you view the sky in extra detail, using intuitive finger gestures.\n\n- Fully configurable. Star Chart displays only the sky objects that you are interested in.\n\n- Allows you to view the sky underneath the horizon. So now you can see where the sun is, even at night!\n\n- Manually set your location to find out what the sky looks like from anywhere in the world.\n\n- Supports dynamic device orientation viewing.

"description":"** App Store's Editor's Choice ** \n\n\n*From the team at ORIGINATOR - the creators of the beloved Endless Alphabet and Sesame Street's Monster at the End of This Book and Another Monster....  Originator is a team of passionate artists and engineers dedicated to the best education+entertainment apps for kids.*\n\nAs a follow-up to Endless Alphabet, set the stage for early reading success with Endless Reader!  This app introduces \"sight words\", the most commonly used words in school, library, and children's books.  Kids need to recognize these words by sight in order to achieve reading fluency.  Recognizing sight words is advantageous for beginning readers because many of these words have unusual spelling, cannot be sounded out using phonics knowledge, and often cannot be represented using pictures. \n\nKids will have a blast learning sight words and their context and usage with the adorable Endless monsters.  Each word features an interactive word puzzle with letters that come alive, and then a sentence puzzle with words that become what they describe.  See the word \"dog\" as a barking dog, and the word \"up\" reach for the sky!\n\n** NOTE: You must be online and have sufficient disk space while running the app to get all words in the app. **\n\nFeatures:\n- 6 words free to try with additional word packs available for purchase.\n- Delightful animations reinforce sight recognition of words in a fun and interactive way.\n- Word puzzles reinforce spelling using lower-case letters and the sentence puzzles teach definition and usage (in addition to sight recognition).\n- Endless Reader was designed with your children in mind.  There are no high scores, failures, limits or stress.

"description":"Nearpod is a must have application for teachers and schools that have access to a set of iPads, iPods, iPhones or Macs for their classes. \n\nWhat's Nearpod? \n\nThe Nearpod platform enables teachers, schools and districts, to use their iPads to manage content on students' iPads, iPhones, iPods or Macs. It seamlessly combines interactive presentation, collaboration, and real-time assessment tools into one integrated solution. \n\nWhat Teachers Are Saying About Nearpod:\n\n\"My students love using the Nearpod app! It allows me to assess my students using polls, multiple choice questions, and open ended questions.\" - Natasha, Spanish Teacher - New York\n\n“I am now able to engage all students during my lessons. There are many parts to Nearpod, but the one that creates active learners in my classroom is Draw It. This feature allows my students to literally draw on any slide I push out to their iPads. “ - Daniel, Teacher & Tech Specialist - New Jersey, \n\n\"Nearpod is a powerful tool! My students love it and it gives me so much flexibility in and out of the classroom. I was using Nearpod in my AP Biology class and one of my students arrived late due to a dentist appointment.

It will become your go-to interactive astro guide to the night sky, following your every movement in real-time and allowing you to explore over 200, 000 celestial bodies with extensive information about stars and constellations that you find. \n\nGet started quickly\n\n• Launch the app and point your iPhone at the night sky, you'll see the stars, planets, satellites,  and constellations in their proper place from your location. As you move your device, the star map updates in real time. The Moon is the easiest first target. \n\n• Tap Augmented Reality icon in the upper right corner to add the image from your camera to your sky view. \n\n• Use Night Mode to go easy on your eyes and preserve night vision when exploring the Universe. \n\n\nGo deeper and beyond\n\n• Every object you tap has an (i) next to its name, tap it to access information.\n\n• A scale on right is the Time Machine, slide it to explore the map of the night sky of tomorrow or years ago. \n\n• A calendar of celestial events will make sure you never miss anything interesting. \n\n• TelRad will help you find the exact position of an object when stargazing with a telescope.\n\n\nShare your experience \n\n• Project to a big screen with no picture quality loss.

It even tells you the names of all the planets. Then, if you point it towards the ground, it shows you what all the stars are in the other hemisphere. It’s brilliant, and if you’re ever somewhere with a clear sky and  no light pollution, it’s a revelation. It’s beautifully designed and makes clever use of the available technology. I’m fascinated by astronomy, but even if you’re not, give this a go.\"\n\nLinks:\nhttp://vitotechnology.com/star-walk.html\nhttp://www.facebook.com/StarWalkApp\nhttp://twitter.com/starwalk", "trackId":295430577, "trackName":"Star Walk™ - 5 Stars Astronomy Guide to the Night Sky Map & Planets", "genreIds":["6017", "6016"], "releaseDate":"2008-11-05T10:24:44Z", "sellerName":"Vito Technology Inc.", "bundleId":"com.vitotechnology.StarWalk",

"description":"*** One of the best educational apps of the year - Apple (iTunes Rewind) ***\nBonjour! Now you can learn French and play games simultaneously. With 9 addictive games designed for essential vocab & conversation skills, MindSnacks’ French app is perfect for adults, kids, students and travelers who wants to read, write and speak one of the world’s most beautiful languages.\n\nInstead of snooze-worthy flashcards, we keep things interesting with rich and unique games designed to help memorize words, practice verb conjugation, and learn word gender. Plus, native speaker audio clips will help make those tough French pronunciations as breezy as a walk through Paris. \n\nDownload the first lesson totally free and if you want more, go ahead and upgrade to get a whopping 50 full lessons and 40+ hours of content. As if that wasn’t enough, scientists now agree that the English language sounds 100% more romantic when spoken in French. \n\n* PRESS *\n\nUSA Today\nOne of the top-three iOS apps that “make the process of learning new words fun.”\n \nApp Safari\n\"This app is not just your average, run-of-the-mill crash course... It includes complex exercises, challenges, and lessons that make the learning process fun and effective.\"\n\nThe PolyGlot Blog\n“In summary, it’s an awesome app – I really recommend that all beginning students of French try it out.”\n\n* FEATURES * \n\n-- 9 addictive and unique games\n-- 1000+ French words & phrases to study and master\n-- Spoken audio clips provided by a native French speaker to help with pronunciation\n-- Hand-illustrated image library to help memorize words\n-- 50 French lessons designed by Ivy League instructors (upgrade required)\n-- Personalized learning algorithms to maximize memorization, retention & contextual usage\n-- Enhanced review mode lets you replay previously mastered lessons\n-- Additional quests & challenges will keep you motivated\n-- Thoughtful curriculum that may induce smiles and the occasional “booyah!!!” when achieving new high scores\n\n* WHAT OUR (SUPER AWESOME) FANS HAVE TO SAY *\n\n“Thank you for creating such a unique app that not only helps me learn French, but makes me WANT to learn. I could have never asked for such an engaging and addicting application.”\n\n“I have the French MindSnacks app on my iPod and I just love it! My roommate has the Portuguese app and to be honest...there are nights when we turn the TV off and spend an hour just MindSnacking!”\n\n“I haven't had this much fun learning since I was a kid! The games are really engaging and they all target different yet essential skills for learning a new language.”\n\n* THE SCIENCE BEHIND MINDSNACKS *\n\nAt MindSnacks we like to keep it fun, but we’re serious about learning. That’s why our French app includes 9 challenging games designed by Ivy League professors. Each game teaches a specific aspect of the language, creating a well-rounded learning experience for both kids and adults that goes far beyond basic vocabulary flashcards. \n\nOf course studying is only worth if it works, so our unique algorithm reinforces the learning process using proven methods from the field of memory studies. Over time, the games adapt to your individual performance, selectively repeating French words, phrases and grammatical points with which you’ve previously struggled. In other words, as you learn French, the app learns about you for a more effective learning experience. \n\nPerfect for beginning and intermediate learners, MindSnacks is like a helpful new French teacher that fits right in your purse, pocket or ever-fashionable fanny pack. You’ll soon spend less time looking at that French dictionary, which means you’ll have more time on that French vacation to gaze up at the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe.\n\n* SUPPORT *\n\nFor more information or support, please contact us at support@mindsnacks.com.

"description":"Explore math with Desmos! Plot functions, create tables, add sliders, animate your graphs, and more -- all for free. \n\nAt Desmos, we imagine a world of universal math literacy and envision a world where math is accessible and enjoyable for all students. We believe the key is learning by doing.\n\nTo achieve this vision, we’ve started by building the next generation of the graphing calculator. Using our powerful and blazingly-fast math engine, the calculator can instantly plot any equation, from lines and parabolas up through derivatives and Fourier series. Sliders make it a breeze to demonstrate function transformations. It's intuitive, beautiful math. And best of all: it's completely free. \n\nFeatures:\n\nGraphing: Plot polar, cartesian, or parametric graphs. There’s no limit to how many expressions you can graph at one time - and you don’t even need to enter expressions in y= form!\n\nSliders: Adjust values interactively to build intuition, or animate any parameter to visualize its effect on the graph\n\nTables: Input and plot data, or create an input-output table for any function\n\nStatistics: Find best-fit lines, parabolas, and more. \n\nZooming: Scale the axes independently or at the same time with the pinch of two fingers, or edit the window size manually to get the perfect window.\n\nPoints of Interest: Touch a curve to show maximums, minimums, and points of intersection. Tap the gray points of interest to see their coordinates. Hold and drag along a curve to see the coordinates change under your finger.\n\nScientific Calculator: Just type in any equation you want to solve and Desmos will show you the answer. It can handle square roots, logs, absolute value, and more.\n\nInequalities: Plot cartesian and polar inequalities.\n\nOffline: No internet access required.\n\nVisit www.desmos.com to learn more and to see the free online version of our calculator.", "genreIds":["6017", "6002"], "releaseDate":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z", "sellerName":"Desmos, Inc.", "bundleId":"com.desmos.Desmos",

"description":"\"OK, so everyone can fold paper in half. What’s so exciting about that?\" you may say. But you’ll soon think differently when you learn more about the art of origami.\nRemember making paper airplanes at school? And remember how someone, instead of an airplane, made a flower, a jumping frog, or a parrot? That was like magic. And they only had their two hands and a plain piece of paper. How did they do it? We’ll show you how.\nThe \"How to Make Origami\" app is simple and easy to use. Follow the step-by-step instructions and watch the 3D animation carefully. And don’t worry, you’d have to try really hard to get confused.\n\n\"Hey, that point shouldn’t be sticking out like that!\" Something went wrong? That’s because even an airplane requires concentration and patience. Let this tranquil pastime completely absorb you, and your complete relaxation is guaranteed. You know, those wise Japanese invented a great thing.  \n\nBy the way, origami develops logical reasoning, attention span, spatial thinking and fine motor skills. Consider that when you’re trying to keep fidgety kids busy.\n\nDownload for free over 80 traditional origami patterns for our app. \n\nThe most famous are\n- Crane\n- Dinosaur\n- Flower\n- Duck\n- Rose\n- Lily\n- Jumping frog\n- Pigeon\n- Rabbit\n\nFold quietly, or your boss may notice!", "genreIds":["6017", "6006"], "releaseDate":"2011-10-19T00:05:13Z", "sellerName":"Sergey Burlakov", "bundleId":"com.mobilicos.howtomakeorigami", "releaseNotes":"- Some models added.", "trackId":472936700, "trackName":"How to Make Origami", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "primaryGenreId":6017, "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "minimumOsVersion":"7.0", "formattedPrice":"Free", "userRatingCount":5849, "averageUserRating":4.5}]

And this is\"\n-- Review by RightyC1\n\nPlease keep in mind that in this version, you now have to specify y=, x=, z= and so on, whenever you want to plot an equation.\n\nThe advanced feature set gives you access to some of the new features, such as implicit graphs and tracing. You need to specify the dependent variable now, since just typing \"x^2\" without the y=, will assume the expression to be \"x^2=0\" and will try to plot it as an implicit graph.\n\nUp to 6 equations can be visualized simultaneously, in both 2D and 3D modes, this limitation can be removed by purchasing the advanced feature set. All the features from the original application are present and will remain free.\n\nIt also includes an evaluate feature, to evaluate equations at specific points, as well as a library where you can store commonly used equations.\n\nFeatures:\n- VGA Output (available with the advanced features package. iPhone 4, 4th gen iPod, and iPad only)\n - 2D - 3D equation plotting.\n- Library for commonly used equations.\n- Wireframe and solid visualization.\n- Support for cartesian, polar, cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems.\n- Pinch to zoom.\n- Drag to rotate - move.\n- Swipe to delete equations from the equation list.\n- Shake to reset view to original state, or to clear entry fields.\n- Double tap to change visualization modes.\n- Enhanced 2D mode for great hi-res graphics.\n- Adaptive 2D algorithms.\n- Enhanced 3D mode with better graphics.\n- In-app email so you can share graphics and equations.\n- Save to photo library.\n- Copy to clipboard.\n- Enhanced equation visualization.\n- Hyperbolic and Inverse functions.\n- New functions such as Min, Max, if.\n- Interactive expression evaluation.\n- Optionally you can unlock implicit graphs, inequalities and other advanced features (via in-app purchase).\n- Turn graphs on/off\n\nThe optional advanced feature set includes:\n- VGA Out\n- 2D tracing.\n- 2D and 3D implicit graphs.\n- 2D and 3D inequalities.\n- Independent 2D zoom\n- Roots and Intersections (2D)\n- Value Table\n- More features to come!\n\nPlease visit the website for more details.", "trackName":"Quick Graph: Your Scientific Graphing Calculator", "genreIds":["6017", "6006"], "releaseDate":"2008-10-06T17:27:21Z", "sellerName":"Alex Restrepo", "bundleId":"com.colombiamug.QuickGraph", "releaseNotes":"Fixing crash when keyboard was dismissed", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "primaryGenreId":6017, "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":false, "formattedPrice":"Free", "minimumOsVersion":"7.0", "userRatingCount":10607, "averageUserRating":4.0}]

If you want to EXPLORE a strange animal island and LEARN PHONETIC LETTER SOUNDS, you shouldn’t wait a minute, and come with me!!! \n\nBut first let me tell you a story…. \n****************************************** \nOnce upon a time, there was an island, an island of indescribable beauty and magnificence. There found a shelter the animals small and large, slimy and furry, savage and tame—all protected from evil hunters and curious eyes, supplied with food from the bountiful earth. Each year, a special event was held, when one, and only one, person from the whole humankind was selected and transported to the island (blinded, to preserve the island’s secrecy) to appreciate its beauty and spread the word about it, so that the island would never be forgotten. \n\nThe legend has it, that deep inside the rocky hill on the island, a treasure is kept. Yet, no one knows its secret anymore because the last humankind representative had enraged the animals on the island, and since then, the animals decided never to invite anyone again, and the island got lost in time and space. \n\nAll that remains from our knowledge is that through the whole island, a very special train goes. The train has a mind of its own and likes it when the passengers’ names start from certain sounds! It is said, that if someone was ever capable to fulfill all the train’s wishes, the train would transport the lucky being deep inside the rocks and reveal the island’s precious treasure! \n****************************************** \n\nBut, you are asking, what does all this have to do with me, monkey Abby? Well, imagine what happened to me just recently! I was flying around with my plane when, out of the blue, the storm hit and my plane got lost! \n\nAnd now, I am on this weird island that looks exactly like the legendary Phonics Island I told you about! Wohoo, how exciting! But I need someone to help me with all the strange tasks the train asks me to do! Do you want to be the one who will help me, and discover the island’s treasure together with me? \n\nThank you for your purchase!", "genreIds":["6017", "6014", "7008", "7009"], "releaseDate":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z", "sellerName":"CFC s.r.o.", "bundleId":"cz.cfc.1068PhonicsIslandLite",

"description":"Don't take any chances at the DMV. With DMV Genius, you'll be prepared. \nDownload right now, be ready to ace your test tomorrow!\n\nGet ready for your 2015 DMV test using questions that are very similar (often identical) to those you'll be asked on the actual test at the DMV. All the practice tests were designed specifically for your state and have the same passing score and the same number of questions as the DMV test, too! \n\nYou'll be surprised how close DMV Genius is to the real thing. It's a fantastic way to study for your written DMV test, especially if you're taking the test for the first time. \n\nAS CLOSE TO THE REAL TEST AS CAN BE:\n• 350 unique questions: 10 separate permit practice tests written specifically for your state\n• Based on your state's official 2015 Driver Handbook\n• Uses the same scoring system (number of questions and passing score) as the DMV\n\nEXTREMELY EFFECTIVE:\n• Questions and answers are randomized each time you take the test\n• Get an explanation for every wrong answer you give\n• Hints for the questions you're not sure about\n\nIMMEDIATE FEEDBACK & REVIEW:\n• Instant feedback after every question\n• Review every single question \n• Marathon Mode: practice until you get 100%!\n• Exam Mode (stops when you pass or fail, allows skipping questions - just like the real test)\n\nWHAT OUR HAPPY USERS ARE SAYING:\n• I passed my permit test so fast the people who worked at the DMV were surprised! ~ Christy, Fairfield, CT\n• Helped me ace my drivers test! I was having a hard time with reading the manual, but this made it so simple! ~ Sdstew, California\n• These tests are so close to the real thing you won’t believe how easy it is when you actually take your permit test ~ Zach Taylor, Kentucky\n• It taught me new things that would probably take me hours to get to in the book. I would totally recommend this app! You won't regret it ~ Att8728, NY \n- Wouldn't have passed if it wasn't for this app! It has a ton of questions and all for free. A lot of questions were word for word on my test ~ Robert Bartolon, CA\n• Superrr helpful! The questions were exactly like the real permit test. I finished my permit test really fast too because I already knew the questions from here! LOVE THIS! ~ J S, New York \n\nSCIENCE BEHIND DMV GENIUS\nResearch proves that multiple choice quizzes help the brain learn: it's called the “testing effect”, or \"repeated retrieval\" phenomenon. (Henry L. Roediger III, Andrew C. Butler from Cornell University).\n\nIf you enjoy using DMV Genius, please take a moment to leave a nice review: it really helps. ^_^\n\nWANT TO TALK TO THE DEVELOPERS?\nIf you have questions or want to report a bug, email the developers through the app (Settings -> Send feedback) or directly via email: info@driving-tests.org.

"description":"Survival skills are techniques a person may use in a dangerous situation (e.g. natural disasters) to save themselves or others (see also bushcraft). Generally speaking, these techniques are meant to provide the basic necessities for human life: water, food, shelter, habitat, and the need to think straight, to signal for help, to navigate safely, to avoid unpleasant interactions with animals and plants, and for first aid. In addition, survival skills are often basic ideas and abilities that ancient humans had to use for thousands of years, so these skills are partially a reenactment of history.

"description":"If you have an iPad, PocketPhonics Lite has been replaced by PocketPhonics Stories Free. If you want an app for iPhone, PocketPhonics Lite still does a great job.\n\n148apps.com: “there’s no denying that “abc PocketPhonics” is an amazing app. A universal app—it works with both iPhone and iPad—PocketPhonics teaches the basics of reading and writing to young kids. Most surprising? It seems to work.”\nTechnology in Education: “If you are working on phonics for your kids, this is the best application to have.”\nWall Street Journal: ‘boy won't put down his mom's iPhone, where she's downloaded \"abc PocketPhonics.\"’\npragmaticmom.com: “This app feels like you have a teacher or a tutor working with your child one on one.”\niPhoneMom.com:  “PocketPhonics is seriously educational and I think it’s a terrific tool for helping early readers.  You can tell that a ton of thought and research was put into it and best of all, they talked and listened to teachers. It shows.”\nEditor's Choice Award 2011 from Children's Technology Review\n\nabc PocketPhonics Lite is the FREE, cut-down version of abc PocketPhonics so you can try before you buy. \n\n*** If you need help, contact us from within the app as we are unable respond to reviews.***\n\nTHREE-APPS-IN-ONE\nUniquely, the full version of abc PocketPhonics combines in one app:\n\n+ Letter sounds\n+ Letter writing\n+ 160 first words\n\nOnly abc PocketPhonics follows the “synthetic phonics” teaching method - the keystone of the “Reading First” part of the “No Child Left Behind Act”.  And makes it fun.\n\nDesigned and reviewed by US and UK teachers who use phonics to teach children to read. It is primarily aimed at preschool kids and those aged up to 7. To understand the best educational practice underpinning abc PocketPhonics, order the free guide to teaching kids to read from the app.\n\nLETTER SOUNDS\nHelps children learn to read by understanding the sounds that letters make. The Congressionally-mandated National Reading Panel concluded that children who have “phonics instruction read better and spell better than other children”.\n\nLetter sounds (how we say letters when we use them in words) are not the same as the letter names (what we call the letters). For instance, sound out slowly to yourself \"cat\". And you can see that the sounds that make up the word are nothing like what we call the letters.\n\nA child who knows their letter names won't actually find that this helps them to read even simple words like “yes\". By contrast, a child who knows their letter sounds will learn to read words they’ve never seen before.\n\nPocketPhonics Lite teaches six letter sounds. The rest are covered in the full version including over 30 letters sounds that come from combining letters together (like “sh” and “ch”), because they are key to reading so many frequently-used words. \n\nLETTER WRITING\nabc PocketPhonics visually demonstrates how to write each letter. Children enjoy practising their writing by tracing the letter with their finger (similar to a Montessori classroom where children learn first to trace letters with their fingers). PocketPhonics also works with iPhone-compatible styluses.\n\nThe Lite version provides a taster of this for the first six letters.\n\nPocketPhonics checks the accuracy of your child's writing (can be switched off and the tolerance varied - using the Settings option in the app's Parentzone). \n\nFIRST WORDS\nUsing a unique, letter-sounds and word game, the full PocketPhonics teaches how to sound out and spell 160 frequently-used words. There’s about 20 words in the Lite version.\n \nThere’s nothing else like it on the App Store. \n\nPARENTAL CONTROL\nUsing the app, you can:\n\n+ Customise it to the needs of your child through its wide range of settings (e.g. lowercase, uppercase, or cursive letters)\n+ Get help or give feedback\n+ Order our free guide on teaching kids to read", "genreIds":["6017", "6014", "7008", "7009"], "releaseDate":"2009-01-19T20:24:36Z", "sellerName":"Apps in My Pocket Ltd", "bundleId":"com.appsinmypocket.iphonics.pocketphonicslite",

"description":"Inspire your baby to sign! Recommended by speech therapists, the adorable Baby Sign and Learn animated characters make signing so much fun! \n\nOne of the most fundamental human desires is to be understood - help your baby communicate by teaching her baby sign language. \n\nThe Baby Sign and Learn app features cute animated video demonstrations that will captive your child. Practice by playing the fun interactive quiz and inspire your baby to sign with the aid of the colorful flashcards.\n\nThis app uses keyword signs and allows you to specify your preferred sign language dialect. Supported signed languages include: American Sign Language (ASL), Australian Sign Language (Auslan), British Sign Language (BSL), Hong Kong Sign Language (HKSL) and New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL). \n\nThis app is free to allow you an opportunity to sample the many features and to try a few signs with your child. Then, if you would like to continue, please consider buying the full version which contains a great selection of baby's first signs. The full version can be purchased in the 'Unlock Signs' section of the app.\n\nWhat people are saying about Baby Sign and Learn:\n\n\"Simple format. Great animated graphics and some authentic voice overs make this one of the best toddler apps on the market!\" ~Static451\n\n\"I am enjoying it big time. My son even enjoys it he's only 15 months can sign bath and eat. He tries to do finish but he can't get his hand right, but he loves sitting there pressing it to watch the signs.\" ~T.L.\n\n\"The layout of your app is amazing to say the least and my one year old who already knows some signs was so into the babies signing instead of the adult that we see in most videos and other apps.\" ~Victoria\n\n\"My granddaughter is 6-months and when she sees my phone she reaches for it and pushes the buttons to see the babies...she loves to look at them\" ~Olivia\n\n\"Winner!\nI love this APP ! I looked for a long time before stumbling across this one, it is by far the BEST. I used to work in pediatrics & did a lot of co-treats with speech therapists & learned a lot from them. As they say, \"If you don't use it, you lose it\" , that happened to me. I especially love the feature of being able to watch the sign ! I highly recommend this for ANY parent/caregiver! Thank you for this incredible app!!\" ~Discojd\n\n\"Love this app\nMy whole family has learned so much from this app. I have 3 kids 8,7 & 3 years old and they are all learning with this. I have told other parents about it too!\" ~Mommy Renee\n\n\"Awesome\nMy baby loves this app. She has learned to communicate her needs quickly & loves to watch the babies.\" ~mamacita3\n\n\"Love it checked different apps and this one is the best! Everybody has fun learning sign language with this app. My children 1-10 years old love it!\" ~Mrs mom of five\n\nVisit http://www.babysignandlearn.com for more information about baby sign language.\n\nPlease Note: it has been stated in a recent review that one of the animated babies has a speech problem. While this was the case with a very early version of the app, it has been resolved for quite some time. If you are still affected by this issue, please visit the 'Unlock Signs' screen and follow the screen prompts to install the free update of the app's downloadable content.", "genreIds":["6017", "7008", "6014", "7009"], "releaseDate":"2011-01-20T04:24:08Z", "sellerName":"The trustee for Trading Mateom Investments Trust", "bundleId":"com.babysignandlearn.baby-sign-and-learn-in-auslan", "releaseNotes":"Fix: content download screen crashing on pre-iOS 7 devices.\nThank you to the users who reported this problem.", "trackId":414830310, "trackName":"Baby Sign and Learn", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "primaryGenreId":6017, "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "minimumOsVersion":"5.1", "formattedPrice":"Free", "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":887}]

Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs. The guest profile is useful for adults who want to play Math Bingo without their scores going into the scoreboard. \n\nSelecting a Game\nThere are five different games in Math Bingo: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Mixed. Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. \n\nBingo Bugs \nBingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug! Players can collect a variety of Bingo Bugs and interact with them by tapping the Bingo Bug button in the player profile or by tapping the My Bingo Bugs button after playing a game. HINT: Tilt your device to make the Bingo Bugs move around, tap on a Bingo Bug to make them giggle and spring! \n\nSettings\nThe settings menu can be accessed by clicking the information button on the lower right hand side the introduction screen.

"description":"*** One of the best educational apps of the year - Apple (iTunes Rewind) ***\nNow you can study SAT vocab by playing games. Need we say more? Featuring 9 addictive games designed to build essential SAT, PSAT & GRE vocabulary, our SAT Vocab app is perfect for students preparing for the SAT exam as well as adults continuing their lifelong quest to become wordsmithing wizards.\n\nMore than just a vocab builder, this app replaces the tedious flashcards used in traditional learning apps with rich and unique games. That means you’ll actually enjoy learning key elements of the SAT such as antonyms, context and spelling, all while boosting your ever- expanding vocabulary.\n\nThe app includes one free lesson for your enjoyment, and for players hoping to crack a seriously high SAT score, go ahead and upgrade to activate all 25 lessons. Before you know it, you’ll be flexing all sorts of vocabulary muscles you never even knew existed.\n\n* PRESS *\n\nThe iPhone Mom\n“What I really like about MindSnacks is how it lowers the stress level in our home.  Taking the SAT is a big deal but now study can be fun too.”\n\nMy College Guide\n“You’ll improve on your spelling skills as well as context, antonyms, and more.” \n\nApp Safari\n\"This app is not just your average, run-of-the-mill crash course... It includes complex exercises, challenges, and lessons that make the learning process fun and effective.\"\n\n* FEATURES * \n\n-- 9 unique mini-games including one designed to teach antonyms\n-- 500 SAT words and phrases to learn, practice, and master\n-- Hand-illustrated image library and spoken audio clips to help memorize words\n-- 25 lessons designed by SAT & PSAT test prep & writing experts (Upgrade required)\n-- Personalized learning algorithms to maximize memorization, retention and SAT scores\n-- Enhanced review mode lets you focus on current or previously mastered lessons\n-- Additional quests & challenges to keep students motivated\n-- Thoughtful curriculum may induce smiles and the occasional “booyah!!!” when achieving new high scores\n\n* WHAT OUR (SUPER AWESOME) FANS HAVE TO SAY *\n\n\"I wish I could give this app 10 stars. I absolutely love it! It has been so helpful in studying, and I feel prepared for the SAT test. The games are interactive and force you to understand the vocabulary, instead of just memorizing it. I recommend this to anyone preparing for a standardized test or wishing to expand their vocabulary.\"\n\n\"This game is great! Such a fun and effective way to study for the SAT. I hate studying for vocab and can never memorize them, but this game is amazing and helps me so much!!\"\n\n* THE SCIENCE BEHIND MINDSNACKS *\n\nAt MindSnacks we like to keep it fun, but we’re serious about learning. That’s why the MindSnacks SAT vocab app includes 9 challenging games designed by Ivy League professors. Each game focuses on a different aspect of vocabulary building, creating a well-rounded learning experience that goes far beyond simple flashcards and word lists. \n\nOf course studying is only worth it if it works, so our unique algorithm reinforces the learning process using proven methods from the field of memory studies. Over time, the games adapt to your individual performance, selectively repeating material from the word lists with which you’ve previously struggled. In other words, as you learn more words, the app learns about you for a more effective learning experience.\n\nPerfect for students preparing for the SAT, PSAT and GRE exam, or adults looking to expand their vocabulary, MindSnacks’ SAT Vocab app is like a helpful vocab tutor that goes where you go and teaches on your terms.\n\n* SUPPORT *\n\nFor more information or support, please contact us at support@mindsnacks.com.

"description":"This is the free, lite version of the world-famous Peekaboo Barn. Farm Day, the new game, is on sale for $1.99: more fun with the same great characters.\n\nA charming barn adventure for toddlers and families you can play on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. \n \nInside a little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out!\n\nPeekaboo Barn Lite introduces you to three of the farm animals. The full version of Peekaboo Barn has 16 animals, a barn party, a goodnight sequence, additional audio options, record your own voice feature, a Spanish version as well as 12 other languages. \n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make! Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find a new animal animation, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Preschoolers will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps them develop early literacy skills. \n\nPeekaboo Barn has been played over 70 Million times worldwide. It has been a top 25 Educational app on the iTunes store every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  The app won the Best Toddler App Ever award for 2009 (MacWorld Expo) and is recommended by the Times, MSNBC, USA Today, and Wired.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we've worked in educational media everywhere from Yahoo! to the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nWhen you could really use a safe distraction - in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms - or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution.

"description":"*** One of the best educational apps of the year - Apple (iTunes Rewind) ***\nNow learning to speak & read Italian from your iPhone or iPad is a total cinch. With 9 addictive games designed for essential vocabulary & conversation skills, MindSnacks’ Italian app is perfect for adults, kids, students, or anyone brushing up on their Italian before taking the grand tour d'Italia.\n\nInstead of tedious flashcards, our app is packed with entertaining games specifically designed to tackle the most common challenges associated with learning Italian. With lessons built around word gender, plural forms, and how to use -ARE, -ERE, and -IRE verbs, it’s fair to say we’ve optimized, or rather awesome-ized, the Italian learning experience.\n\nDownload the first lesson totally free and if you crave more Italian, upgrade to access all 50 lessons and 40+ hours of content. That’s more than enough to fill the entire Roman Colosseum (we double-checked). \n\n* PRESS *\n\nUSA Today\nOne of the top-three iOS apps that “make the process of learning new words fun.” \n\n148 Apps\n\"It's fun to do and it's amazing how quickly users will notice results.\"\n\nAppo Learning\n“MindSnacks provides some of the best instruction on the Italian language in the app-verse...”\n\nApp Safari\n\"This app is not just your average, run-of-the-mill crash course... It includes complex exercises, challenges, and lessons that make the learning process fun and effective.\" \n\n* FEATURES * \n\n-- 9 addictive and unique games\n-- 1000+ Italian words & phrases to study and master\n-- Spoken audio clips provided by a native Italian speaker to help with pronunciation\n-- Hand-illustrated image library to help memorize words\n-- 50 Italian lessons designed by Ivy League instructors (upgrade required)\n-- Personalized learning algorithms to maximize memorization, retention & contextual usage\n-- Enhanced review mode lets you replay previously mastered lessons\n-- Additional quests & challenges will keep you motivated\n-- Not a single boring, mind-numbing or snooze-inducing quiz, class or lesson allowed\n \n* WHAT OUR (SUPER AWESOME) FANS HAVE TO SAY *\n\n“I got this app to help me learn as much Italian as I could before a two week vacation to Italy. I'm currently over half way done with my vacation and the app was a huge help!”\n\n“I found Mindsnacks (from the comfort of my pillow) by doing a web search for ‘best app to learn Italian’....Within 15 minutes I had learned to count to ten (AND I also knew how to spell the words).”\n\n“Great app!! Fun and makes it easy to learn! Well worth the money!”\n\n* THE SCIENCE BEHIND MINDSNACKS *\n\nAt MindSnacks we like to keep it fun, but we’re serious about learning. That’s why our Italian app includes 9 challenging games designed by Ivy League professors. Each game teaches a specific aspect of the Italian language, creating a well-rounded learning experience for both kids and adults that goes far beyond basic vocabulary flashcards. \n\nOf course studying is only worth it if it works, so our unique algorithm reinforces the learning process using proven methods from the field of memory studies. Over time, the games adapt to your individual performance, selectively repeating Italian words, phrases and grammatical points with which you’ve previously struggled. In other words, as you learn Italian, the app learns about you for a more effective learning experience.\n\nPerfect for beginning and intermediate learners of Italian, Mindsnacks is like a helpful new Italian teacher that fits in your purse, pocket or ever-fashionable fanny pack. You’ll quickly become less reliant on that Italian dictionary so you can focus on more important stuff like booking your trip to Venice.\n\n* SUPPORT *\n\nFor more information or support, please contact us at support@mindsnacks.com.

"description":"\"If you want your kid to be a better speller, then download this app now!  With this app spelling tests become a fun activity that your kids look forward to each time.\"\n\nEndorsed by tens of thousands of satisfied parents, teachers, and kids the world over. \n\nWHAT MAKES A+ SPELLING TEST UNIQUE?\n• Setup your own spelling tests in minutes\n\n• You decide which words to add and practice\n\n• Track your kids progress and quickly see how they are doing for each test they took as well as which words if any they are struggling with.\n\n• Multiple play modes keep kids engaged.  If you don't want to take a test, you can use the practice mode or let your kids unscramble the words\n\n• Practice spelling on the go.  This app is perfect for using no matter where you are.\n\n• HUGE time saver!  Finally kids can rapidly boost their spelling test scores without your help.  \n\n• Submit homework by email!  After taking a spelling test, just click to submit the results instantly to your teacher and get credit for doing your homework in a whole new way.\n\nHOW TO USE A+ SPELLING TEST?\n\n1. Create a test\n1.1. Choose the list name\n1.2. Add words - words are immediately checked for spelling to avoid mistakes\n1.3. For each word you add, record your own audio - a kids favorite\n\n2. Take a test\n2.1. Listen to the word you need to spell - words appear in random order\n2.2. Write the word and click next\n2.3. Instantly see if you got it right or wrong \n\n3. Review test scores\n3.1 Each time you take a test, you see a detailed report with all the words you got right and wrong.\n3.2 Next to each word, you see a green (correct) or red (wrong) indicator so you can quickly see what words kids tend to struggle with repeatedly.\n3.3 Next to each Spelling List you see the test results of the last test they took\n\nADVANCED OPTIONS\n\n• Ace it - Instead of taking a regular test, when you click to \"Ace it\" you have to keep repeating words until you spell them correctly.  Since feedback and repetition is the best way to learn, your kids will improve even faster and enjoy it because by the end they will have aced every test!\n\n• Practice - The practice mode does not track your score and offers a quick preview of each word when needed with just one click.  Its a fun and easy way to get familiar with especially challenging new words.\n\n• Unscramble - The unscramble mode activates and develops a completely different part of your brain.  Instead of instantly hearing the word and having to spell it, you see a scramble of letters and have to figure out what word they are for.  It's fun and another great way to sharpen your kids spelling skills\n\n• Review mistakes - With each test you took, you can choose to quickly just retest any / all mistakes.  In addition, on the main page, you can always click to review all the words that were misspelled on their last attempt.\n\n• Enhanced email submission - Can't remember your kids teachers email?  No problem.  Enter it only once on the settings page and each time you click to email out the test, the teacher's email address will be pre-filled in the TO field.\n\n• Clear Test Scores - at any time, you can delete all previous test scores from the settings page with one click or delete individual test scores one at a time.\n\nHeroic Support\n****************************************\n\nHeroic Support is not just what we do.  It's really what makes us, well, us.  It's that drive to make a difference in your life - no matter how big or small.

The perfect complements to \"Learning Japanese\"! Just search for \"Japanese Alphabet Study Guide\" or \"Kana Kanji Funtime\" and download today! \n*********************** \n\n\nTae Kim's Guide to Learning Japanese now available in the app store! Topics covered include: \n\n- The Japanese Writing System (Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji)\n- Basic Japanese Grammar (Particles, Gobi, Tense, etc.)\n- Essential Japanese Grammar (Polite Forms, Conditionals, etc.)\n- Special Expressions (Causative, Amounts, Honorific, etc.)\n- Advanced Topics (Formal Expressions, Volitional, etc.)\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA Japanese guide to learning Japanese grammar\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis guide is an attempt to systematically build up the grammatical structures that make up the Japanese language in a way that makes sense in Japanese. It may not be a practical tool for quickly learning immediately useful Japanese phrases (for example, common phrases for travel). However, it will logically create grammatical building blocks that will result in a solid grammatical foundation. For those of you who have learned Japanese from textbooks, you may see some big differences in how the material is ordered and presented. This is because this guide does not seek to forcibly create artificial ties between English and Japanese by presenting the material in a way that makes sense in English. Instead, examples with translations will show how ideas are expressed in Japanese resulting in simpler explanations that are easier to understand.\n\n\n\n=======================\n\nPlease note that this application does not contain Romaji. You will be required to learn the Kana (Hiragana and Katakana) to be able to fully complete this guide. Don't worry though, it's covered in the \"Writing System\" section.\n\n=======================", "genreIds":["6017", "6006"], "releaseDate":"2010-06-21T19:59:17Z", "sellerName":"Ronald Timoshenko", "bundleId":"com.ronaldtimoshenko.learningjapanese", "releaseNotes":"- Added iPhone5 & iOS6 Support\n- Fixed brightness slider", "trackId":377785100, "trackName":"Learning Japanese", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "primaryGenreId":6017, "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":false, "minimumOsVersion":"4.3", "averageUserRating":4.0, "userRatingCount":1130}]

"description":"The My Smart Hands Baby Sign Language Dictionary app comes with over 300 signs.  This Lite version comes with 120 signs and has all the functionality of the original.  What is unique about this app is that it is a video dictionary that not only shows you the ASL signs, but also explains how to do them or gives you great memory tips on how to remember and understand them.  The full app features over 45 minutes of instructional video from ASL instructor and My Smart Hands founder Laura Berg!  Try our LITE version to see how much you'll benefit from this app when teaching your baby sign language.\n\nThis app was created by My Smart Hands (www.mysmarthands.com), an international baby sign language program with over 150 instructors in over 10 countries, under the direction of its founder Laura Berg.  Laura has a BA in child studies, an M.Ed and a certificate in ASL and Deaf Studies. She is passionate about education and signing and has brought that passion to My Smart Hands.\n\nKeep track of the signs you want to work on in your own favorites list, and arrange those signs in any order you like.

Parents can select which subjects they want, set different difficulty levels, and even choose specific questions. Parents can review performance history for each subject to check how their child is doing. \n\nTeachMe: Kindergarten keeps children engaged with a rather unique reward system where children earn a coin for every three correct answers. Coins can then be used to purchase stickers to place in fun sticker scenes or to purchase items for the new virtual aquarium. Sticker scenes can be exported as wallpaper or emailed to family and friends. \n\nThe simple and intuitive user interface is designed to be child friendly, which allows children to play without help from an adult. An animated teacher (Mimi Mouse) gives verbal instructions and feedback to the child which makes learning fun. \n\nFEATURES: \n• Virtual Aquarium reward (4 types of fish and 40+ items) \n• 6 different sticker reward scenes: farm, beach, underwater reef, pirate cove, city, playground \n• Over 150 different stickers for adding to scenes \n• Save learning information for up to 40 students \n• Select which subjects are displayed for each student \n• Turn on/off specific questions within a subject \n• Change the number of correct questions to earn a reward \n• Change the number of questions in a row to mark a question learned \n• Tracks performance for each subject item (last five) \n• Export sticker rewards scenes to Photos, for emailing or using as wallpaper \n\nLEARNING SUBJECTS: \n• Sight Words: Dolch (Pre-K), Dolch (K) \n• Addition: up to a total of 10 \n• Subtraction: from 10 down \n• Spelling: complete words by choosing the missing letter \n• Letter Writing: how to write letters a-z, A-Z\n• Number Writing: how to write numbers 0-9. \n\nEmail us at support@24x7digital.com for help & suggestions as we cannot respond to reviews. \n\nBe sure to try the other apps in the TeachMe series: TeachMe: Toddler, TeachMe: 1st Grade, TeachMe: 2nd Grade, and TeachMe: 3rd Grade!", "genreIds":["6017", "6014", "7008", "7009"], "releaseDate":"2009-11-12T15:36:57Z", "sellerName":"24x7digital LLC", "bundleId":"com.24x7digital.Kindergarten", "releaseNotes":"• TeachTech writing recognition improvements.\n• Various bug fixes and enhancements.", "trackId":336689375, "trackName":"TeachMe: Kindergarten", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "primaryGenreId":6017, "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "minimumOsVersion":"5.1.1", "formattedPrice":"$1.99", "averageUserRating":4.0, "userRatingCount":2547}]

"releaseNotes":"2.3\n- Student portfolios are now part of Showbie Pro! You and your students can instantly tag any document, comment, or grade from any assignment to be included in a personal portfolio. It’s a great way to collect examples of your students’ best work, and show evidence of their progress over time. Next parent-teacher night will be a breeze.\n- We’ve added the ability to copy classes. This means you can take a class from last year, complete with all assignments and shared materials, and easily reuse it with your new students this year! The copy class feature is included in both Showbie Basic and Showbie Pro.\n- You can now create assignments without a due date. Great for long-term projects or ongoing tasks, or if you just want to let your students know what a cool and easygoing teacher you are.\n- Works great on iOS9!\n\n2.2\n- The Showbie Gradebook is here! Teachers using Showbie Pro can now add grades while viewing student work. Grade entry is super fast and flexible – you can add anything from 10/10, 100%, A+, or even your favorite emoji! When you’re done you can review grades at a glance, and if you need to, export your grades to another system.\n- A big upgrade to the pen tool! Now you can use two fingers to pan and zoom around a document while the pen tool is selected. We’ve also upgraded the pen to create smoother, more natural lines for better quality writing and drawing.\n- Student Search! Teachers can now see and search a list of all students across all of their classes. Pick a student from this list and get a summary of that student’s classes, assignments, and grades all in one place.\n- We’ve added an ‘All Assignments’ view for students and teachers, allowing students and teachers to see upcoming tasks and due dates across all of their classes.\n- The Showbie website is now available in 12 languages, just like the iOS app.\n\n2.1\n- We’ve added a new way for you to try out Showbie Pro! Invite your fellow teachers to try Showbie, and when one of them signs up, we’ll upgrade both of you to Showbie Pro for 2 weeks!\n- Pinned Voice Notes (Pro Feature). Now you can pin a voice note to any page of a PDF or image, making verbal feedback easier than ever!\n- You may now PERMANENTLY delete archived classes and assignments if you like. Don’t say we didn’t warn you!\n- Teachers and students can now customize their notification settings from within the iOS app.\n- We added an easier way to remove yourself from a class if you’re a co-teacher. As well, students can now elect to remove themselves from a class in the iOS app.\n- You can now read super-super-long pinned text notes in their entirety. The display of notes imported from other PDF editors is also improved.\n\n2.0\n- Showbie is now available on iPhone and iPod touch! Take your class with you everywhere, on any iOS device. Who needs Wifi?\n- We love our international teachers and students! Showbie is now available in Spanish, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Arabic, French, Norwegian, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese!\n\nLike using Showbie?
